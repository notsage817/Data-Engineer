# Data Warehouse
## Business Perspective
Business is about a set of processes, including *Operational Processes* and *Analytical Processes*
> Eg. A retail's data infrastructure
> ##### Operational Process
> - customers should be able to find goods & make orders
> - Inventory staff should be able to stock, retrieve & re-order goods
> - Delivery staff should be able to pick up & deliver goods
> ##### Analytical Process
> - HR should be able to access the performance of sales staff
> - Marketing should be able to see the effect of different sales channels
> - Management should be able to monitor sales growth
##### A database could not satisfy the demand of both kind of processes. Data Warehouse is a system which includes the processes and technologies and data representations that enable the support to analytical process.
### OLAP vs OLTP
#### OLAP: Online Analytical Processing
#### OLTP: Online Transactional Processing
