### Four key machine components
+ CPU
2.5 Gigahertz CPU means that CPU processes 2.5 billion operations per second
Computer operate 8 bytes data per operation
+ Memory
"efficient, expensive, ephemeral"
+ Storage
slow when deal with gigabyte or terabyte data
+ Network
The bottlenect when working with big data
