### Four key machine components
+ *CPU*
  + 2.5 Gigahertz CPU means that CPU processes 2.5 billion operations per second,Computer operate 8 bytes data per operation
  + 200 times faster than memory
+ *Memory*
  + "efficient, expensive, ephemeral"
  + 15 times faster than SSD
+ *Storage*
  + slow when deal with gigabyte or terabyte data
  + 20 times faster than network
+ *Network*
  + The bottlenect when working with big data
